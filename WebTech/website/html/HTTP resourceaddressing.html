    <p>
        An excerpt from Tim Berners-Lee, et. al. in rfc 3986: uniform resource identifier (uri): generic syntax:A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both. The term “Uniform Resource Locator” (URL) refers to the subset of URIs that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network “location”). (Difference Between URLs and URIs. (n.d.))
