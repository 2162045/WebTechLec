          Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a protocol in exchanging or transferring hypertext on the World Wide Web.A protocol is sent over TCP, or over a TLS-encrypted TCP connection,though any reliable transport protocol.HTTP is widely used to access resources (hypertext/multimedia on the World Wide Web and for  fetching of resources, such as HTML documents.It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.The development was initiated by Tim Berners Lee at CERN in Conseill European on 1989 and jointly adopted by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and the standard development of it was coordinated by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).

        <p>HTTP Four Versions:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            HTTP 0.9  
               <br>
                This is the first initial version of HTTP .It has  a simple client-server, request-response, telnet-friendly protocol.The method supported of HTTP 0.9 is GET only and its request nature is single-line.On this version there is no HTTP headers (cannot transfer other content type files), No status/error codes, No URLs, No versioning.The popular web servers (Apache, Nginx) still supports HTTP/0/9.

        <p>
            HTTP 1 <a href=" https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945">RFC 1945</a>
            <br>
                HTTP 1.0 version provides header fields including rich metadata about both request and response (HTTP version number, status code, content type).Unlike HTTP 0.9 that the response is limit only in hypertext,HTTP 1.0 version response is  not limited to hypertext (Content-Type header provided ability to transmit files other than plain HTML files — e.g. scripts, stylesheets, media).It supports  GET , HEAD , POST method.
