<h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
     <p>
          <div class="tooltip">Hypertext Transfer Protocol<div class="tooltiptext">
						<img src="./images/http1.jpg" alt="tim berners"></div></div><p> is a protocol in exchanging
							or transferring hypertext on the World Wide Web.A protocol is sent over TCP, or over
							a TLS-encrypted TCP connection,though any reliable transport protocol.
							HTTP is widely used to access resources (hypertext/multimedia on the World Wide Web and for  fetching of
							resources, such as HTML documents.It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.</p>
					<div class="tooltip">Tim Berners Lee<div class="tooltiptext">

							European on 1989 and jointly adopted by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and
							the standard development of it was coordinated by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).
        </p>
        <p>HTTP Four Versions:</p>
        <p>HTTP 0.9</p>
                <p>This is the first initial version of HTTP .It has  a simple client-server,
									request-response, telnet-friendly protocol.The method supported of HTTP 0.9 is
									GET only and its request nature is single-line.On this version there is no HTTP headers
									(cannot transfer other content type files), No status/error codes, No URLs,
									No versioning.The popular web servers (Apache, Nginx) still supports HTTP/0/9.</p>
        <p>HTTP 1 <a href=" https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945">RFC 1945</a></p>
                <p>HTTP 1.0 version provides header fields including rich metadata about
									both request and response (HTTP version number, status code, content type).
									Unlike HTTP 0.9 that the response is limit only in hypertext,HTTP 1.0 version
									response is  not limited to hypertext (Content-Type header provided ability
									to transmit files other than plain HTML files — e.g. scripts, stylesheets, media).
									It supports  GET , HEAD , POST method.</p>

        <p>HTTP 1.1</p>
            <p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc260">RFC 2608, JANUARY 1997 </a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616 JUN 1999 </a></p>
            <p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">RFC 7230 JUN 2014 </a></p>

        <p>HTTP 2</p>

<h2>HTTP FUNDAMENTALS</h2>

        <p>The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on the client/server based architecture where web browsers,
        robots and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients, and the Web server acts as a server.
				<ul>
            <li>HTTP runs on the top of TCP(Transmission Protocol)/IP(Internet Protocol) using TCP port 80 by the default or TCP port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS).
            <li>HTTP is text based; the basic unit of HTTP communication is the message.
            <li>Basically,HTTP uses request-response protocol,that the client will sends an HTTP requests message to the server.
            <li>HTTP is based on a client -server architecture
						</ul>

                <p>Servers: origin server,proxy server,gateways,tunnels</p></p>
                <p>origin server - actual machine,where resource is located.</p>
                <p>Proxy server - An intermediary program which acts as both a server and a client for
									the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients. Proxies are often used as
									client-side portals through network firewalls and as helper applications for handling
									requests via protocols not implemented by the user agent.</p>
                <p>Server - An application program that accepts connections in order to service requests
									by sending back responses.</p>
                <p>Gateway - a gateway receives requests as if it were the origin server for the requested
									resource; the requesting client may not be aware that it is communicating with a gateway.
									Gateways are often used as server-side portals through network firewalls and as protocol
									translators for access to resources stored on non-HTTP systems.</p>
                <p>Tunnel - A tunnel is an intermediary program which is acting as a blind relay between two connections.</p>
                <p>Client A.K.A</p>
                <p>An application program that makes a connections for the purpose of sending requests.</p>
                <p>The client which initiates a request (browsers, editors, spiders).</p>


                  <p>HTTP is  a stateless communications protocol ,that servers do not keep in of
										about clients in between requests(simple implementations).</p>

									<p>HTTP provides a support for other functionalities such as:</p>
									<ul>
                    <li>cache control
                    <li>content media type Multi purpose Internet Mail Extensions(MIME)
                    <li>language and character set specification
                    <li>content/transfer codings
                    <li>client-server protocol negotiations(http1-http2)
                    <li>request pipelining/multiplexing
                    <li>pipelining is the process where more than one request from the client.
                    <li>authentication/authorization(control over accessing credentials).
										</ul>
        </p>

	<h2>HTTP RESOURCE ADDRESSING</h2>

		<p>HTTP RESOURCE are identified using Uniform Resource Identifier’s  (RFC 3986) or more specifically HTTP URLs.</p>
    <p>An excerpt from Tim Berners-Lee, et. al. in rfc 3986: uniform resource identifier (uri): generic
			syntax:A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies
			an abstract or physical resource.A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both.
			The term “Uniform Resource Locator” (URL) refers to the subset of URIs that, in addition to
			identifying a resource, provide a means of locating the resource by describing its primary
			access mechanism (e.g., its network “location”). (Difference Between URLs and URIs. (n.d.))</p>
        <p>Scheme (http or https)</p>
        <p>scheme indicates the addressing system.</p>

  			<p>*Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http)</p>
            <p>*HTTP Secure is an adaptation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol,it is the secure version of HTTP.</p>

            <p>Authority (user:pwd)</p>
                <p>user information</p>
                <p>Host -domain name</p>
                <p>Port - default 80</p>
            <p>Path to resource</p>
                <p>It refers to the document root(WAMP,UBUNTU)  on the server and may refer to static or dynamic</p>
            <p>Query</p>
                <p>It starts in question mark (?)</p>
                <p>Typically provided as key = value pairs with ampersand (&amp;) separator between key value pairs</p>

	<h2>HTTP REQUEST METHODS</h2>

<p>are methods used by clients to request some resources to the server. And every request has a corresponding response.
	There are 8 standard methods in HTTP it includes the GET, HEAD, POST (from HTTP/1.0), PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE and CONNECT method (from HTTP/1.1). And recently PATCH method were added and it was determined by RFC 5789.</p>

<p>GET - request data from a pa resource.</p>
<p>HEAD - similar as the GET method but the only difference is it only returns the HTTP headers or the metadata.</p>
<p>POST - performs submission of data to a particular resource to be processed.</p>
<p>PUT - create or replace something. It uploads a report of the specified URI.</p>
<p>DELETE - removes the target resource.</p>
<p>OPTIONS - recommends more choices that the server supports.</p>
<p>TRACE - used for testing/diagnosing of the response or request chain.</p>
<p>CONNECT - establishes a tunnel to the destination origin master</p>
<p>PATCH - provides partial changes to a resource.</p>

			<p>(GET, HEAD, POST)</p>

  <h2>HTTP MESSAGE HEADER FIELDS</h2>


	<ul>
  <li>General header: used by both client and server</li>
  <li>Request header: used only by clients-user agent (client message)</li>
  <li>Response header: used only by server (server message)</li>
  <li>Entity header: referred to an entity.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">HTTP RESPONSE STATUS CODES</a></h2>


 <p> HTTP response status codes is an indication if a HTTP request has been processed successfully. HTTP response status codes are specified in section 10 of RFC 2616. </p>

  <p> These are grouped in five classes it includes:</p>


	<ul>
		 <li><p><a href="#ir">Information responses 1xx</a></p></li>
		<li><p><a href="#sr">Successful responses 2xx</a></p></li>
		<li><p><a href="#rm">Redirection messages 3xx</a></p></li>
