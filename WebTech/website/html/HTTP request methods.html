		GET - request data from a pa resource.
			
		HEAD - similar as the GET method but the only difference is it only returns the HTTP headers or the metadata.
		
		POST - performs submission of data to a particular resource to be processed.
		
		PUT - create or replace something. It uploads a report of the specified URI.
		
		DELETE - removes the target resource.
		
		OPTIONS - recommends more choices that the server supports.
