        The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on the client/server based architecture where web browsers, 
        robots and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients, and the Web server acts as a server.


                HTTP runs on the top of TCP(Transmission Protocol)/IP(Internet Protocol) using TCP port 80 by the default or TCP port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS).
                HTTP is text based; the basic unit of HTTP communication is the message.
                Basically,HTTP uses request-response protocol,that the client will sends an HTTP requests message to the server.

                HTTP is based on a client -server architecture  
                    Servers: origin server,proxy server,gateways,tunnels
                origin server - actual machine,where resource is located.
                Proxy server - An intermediary program which acts as both a server and a client for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients. Proxies are often used as client-side portals through network firewalls and as helper applications for handling requests via protocols not implemented by the user agent.
                Server - An application program that accepts connections in order to service requests by sending back responses.
                Gateway - a gateway receives requests as if it were the origin server for the requested resource; the requesting client may not be aware that it is communicating with a gateway. Gateways are often used as server-side portals through network firewalls and as protocol translators for access to resources stored on non-HTTP systems.
                Tunnel - A tunnel is an intermediary program which is acting as a blind relay between two connections. 


                Client A.K.A
                An application program that makes a connections for the purpose of sending requests.
                The client which initiates a request (browsers, editors, spiders).
        

                    HTTP is  a stateless communications protocol ,that servers do not keep in of about clients in between requests(simple implementations).
                    HTTP provides a support for other functionalities such as: 
                    -cache control
                    -content media type Multi purpose Internet Mail Extensions(MIME)
                    -language and character set specification
                    -content/transfer codings
                    -client-server protocol negotiations(http1-http2)
                    -request pipelining/multiplexing 
                    *pipelining is the process where more than one request from the client.
                    -authentication/authorization(control over accessing credentials).
