        <h2>What is PHP?</h2>
        <p>PHP is a scripting language on the server-side the is defined on a web server to be displayed to a web browser.</p>
        <h3>VERSIONS:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Version 1:</li>
            <p>Lerdorf re-programmed the Common Gateway Interface or CGI binaries in the C programming language. He expanded the scripts to have the functionality to work well with databases, thus PHP/FI is born. PHP/FI stands for "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter". It was released in 1994.</p>
            <li>Version 2:</li>
            <p>Lerdorf began to create a development team. He and his team improved PHP/FI 1 by including various Perl-like variables, and the ability to embed Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML). PHP/FI 2 was released in November 1997.</p>
            <li>Version 3:</li>
            <p>Another two years have passed, two israeli developers namely, Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski, formed PHP 3 by rewriting the previous versions of PHP. They changed the name from PHP/FI to PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP 3 was released in June 1998.</p>
            <li>Version 4:</li>
            <p>Suraski and Gutmans started anew with PHP and created Zend Engine in 1999. Zend Technologies is thus born in Ramat Gan, Isarael. PHP 4 was then released the next year. PHP 4 ended with Version 4.4.9 and was no longer in development.</p>
            <li>Version 5:</li>
            <p>Powered by Zend Engine II, PHP 5 was released on July 13, 2004. This version included imporved with features like: supporting object-oriented programming. It became the only PHP version that was stable for further developments. </p>
            <li>Version 6: (Delayed)</li>
            <p>As PHP 5 is under development for imporvements, developers also planned to release a newer version called PHP 6. PHP 6 was supposed to have Unicode support. Thus, developers delayed the launch of PHP 6.</p>
