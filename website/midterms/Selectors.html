		<h3>Specificity</h3>
		<p>The more specific you are in targeting the element by using different selectors the more 			
		likely it would be following the style implemented. Inline styles such as italic or bold 			
		will override styles from external style sheets. Universal selectors do not have any 			
		effect on specificity including combinators like (eg. >, ~). The !important method 			
		overrides all declarations. This method may be effective but a bad practice since it 			
		would be more difficult during the debugging process. Specificity will be applied to the 			
		element with multiple declarations and will take precedence based on the value of the 			
		selectors.</p>

		<h3>Selector Types</h3>
		<p>Selectors are combined to form patterns and target certain elements.</p>
		<p>Tier-1</p>
			<ul>
				<li>id selectors</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Tier-2</p>
			<ul>
				<li>class selectors</li>
				<li>attribute selectors</li>
				<li>pseudo-classes</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Tier-3</p>
			<ul>
				<li>pseudo-elements</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Origin of Style Sheets</h3>
		<p>CSS' algorithm is to determine CSS declarations 
		in order to choose the appropriate values for CSS properties.</p>
		<p>author – specifies style sheet for a source document 
		according to the conventions of the document language.</p>
		<p>user – the user may specify a file that contains a 
		style sheet or the user agent may provide an interface that 
		generates a user style sheet.</p>
		<p>user agent – A user agent's default style sheet 
		should present the elements of the document language 
		in ways that satisfy general presentation expectations.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h3>Calculating CSS Specificity Value</h3>
		<p>The browser calculates each selectors' specificity value and 
		then compares them to check which among them is the highest 
		and applies the declarations to the element targeted</p>
		<p>Highest Specificity → Lowest Specificity</p>
		<p>Style Attribute → ID → Class, pseudo-class, attribute → Elements</p>
		<p>Sample “ul#nav li.toggled a”</p>
		
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Style Attribute</th>
				<th>ID</th>
				<th>class, pseudo-class, attrb</th>
				<th>Elements</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>0</td>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>3</td>
