                as high-level interpreted programming language.It is commonly used in making dyamic webpages interactive.

               <p> Javascript is only implemented in client-side in web browser.Client-side code run in browser
                after page is sent back from server often this code manipultes the
                page or response to user actions.

                <p> Browser Object Model 
                It is  a browser-specific convention that talks about all the objects
                 contained by the web browser.BOM has no standard for implementation.

                      As stated on W3C Recommendation:With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
                    <ul>
                     <li>According to W3C Recommendation, JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page</li>
                    <li>According to W3C Recommendation,JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page</li>
                   <li> According to W3C Recommendation,JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page</li>
                    <li>According to W3C Recommendation,JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes</li>
                    <li>According to W3C Recommendation,JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes</li>
                    <li>According to W3C Recommendation,JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page</li>
                    <li>According to W3C Recommendation,JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page</li>
            </ul>
                 <p>Document Object Model
                    
                    As defined on the W3C Recommendation,Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for
                     valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It interacts with the document within the script.When a page is loaded,the DOM is created on the page.
                     DOM actually allows to the HTML document from within scripts.
