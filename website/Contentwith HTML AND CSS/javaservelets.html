        <h2>JAVA SERVLETS</h2>
        <p>Java Servlets are server-side programming applications that execute similar to CGI scripts,but without a separate process for each request(David Reily, Michael Reily,2012).It is described as a java object that are intended to play the role server components in client-server communications and a java class extending HTTPServlet class. It handles client requests by generating responses to such requests. A java servlets class needs to be compiled prior to using it; it must use servley-api.jar. Java Servlets are part of the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE). It is run inside a Servlet compatible "Servlet Container" (e.g. web server) in order for them to work such as Jelly, Apache Tomcat that are free Java web servers. </p>
        <p>Servlets is hosted in a ‘servlet container’ that provides the environment in which the server run as the ‘servlet life cycle’.</p>

        <p> Servlet Container is known as servlet engine which manages Java Servlet components on top of a web server to the request send by the client. </p>
