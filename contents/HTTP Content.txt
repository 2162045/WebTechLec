	HTTP RESPONSE METHODS	
	METHOD PROPERTIES
	HEADERS CLASSIFICATION
	
		Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:

			General header: Headers applying to both requests and responses but with no relation to the data eventually transmitted in the body.
			Request header: Headers containing more information about the resource to be fetched or about the client itself.
			Response header: Headers with additional information about the response, like its location or about the server itself (name and version etc.).
			Entity header: Headers containing more information about the body of the entity, like its content length or its MIME-type.

		Headers can also be grouped according to how proxies handle them:

			End-to-end headers
			These headers must be transmitted to the final recipient of the message; that is, the server for a request or the client for a response. Intermediate proxies must retransmit end-to-end headers unmodified and caches must store them.
			Hop-by-hop headers
			These headers are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection and must not be retransmitted by proxies or cached. Such headers are: Connection, Keep-Alive, Proxy-Authenticate, Proxy-Authorization, TE, Trailer, Transfer-Encoding and Upgrade. Note that only hop-by-hop headers may be set using the Connection general header.
